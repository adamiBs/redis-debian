# Security Policy

## Supported Debian Distributions

We support Debian versions that are under [`Debian Security Support / stable versions`](https://wiki.debian.org/Status/Stable) that are officially supported by Debian. [Updated support matrix](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/).

We encourage you to use the latest stable Debian version, and to consider that the 'LTS' versions of Debian are maintained by volunteers - not by the Debian security team.

### Supported Versions

Please refer to our security policy [here](https://github.com/redis/redis/security)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a serious vulnerability, please contact the
Redis core team at `redis@redis.io`. We will evaluate your report and if
necessary issue a fix and an advisory. If the issue was previously undisclosed,
we'll also mention your name in the credits.

## Responsible Disclosure

In some cases, we may apply a responsible disclosure process to reported or
otherwise discovered vulnerabilities. We will usually do that for a critical
vulnerability, and only if we have a good reason to believe information about
it is not yet public.

This process involves providing an early notification about the vulnerability,
its impact and mitigations to a short list of vendors under a time-limited
embargo on public disclosure.

If you believe you should be on the list, please contact us and we will
consider your request based on the above criteria.
